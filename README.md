# BeaLC Player :boom:

## Key scripts :vertical_traffic_light: :page_with_curl:

- `npm install` - install dependencies so we can use the application
- `npm start` - start the application in development mode
- `npm run build` - build the application into production-ready client and server-side bundles
- `npm run server` - start the application server same as we would as if it were deployed in production
- `npm run build:server` - build the application and start the server-side application from source code (allowing us to connect a debugger and stop on code that is executed server-side)
